# Mobile App Automation with Appium and Python

This project demonstrates the automation of a mobile app using Appium, Python, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It showcases the booking process of a hotel reservation application. The code includes the implementation of various functions such as selecting rooms, filling personal information, and handling different UI elements.

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python installed. If not, install it from (https://www.python.org/).
2. Download and install the Appium server from (http://appium.io/downloads.html).
3. Set up an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device.
4. Update the desired capabilities in the code with the appropriate device details.

## Files and Directories

- `appium_actions.py`: Contains the AppiumActions class with functions for interacting with the mobile app.
- `main_script.py`: Implements the test automation script using the functions defined in `appium_actions.py`.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.


## Usage

1. Run the Appium server.
2. Execute the `main_script.py` file to run the automation script.
